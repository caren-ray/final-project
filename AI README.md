\#  **AI-Powered Bug Predictor (Breast Cancer Classification)**



This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict software bugs using a breast cancer dataset as a stand-in for real bug data. It showcases the workflow of training a classifier, identifying the most important features, and evaluating the model’s performance — all in Google Colab.



\##  **Overview**



The goal is to use classification techniques to detect patterns that may be useful for predicting software defects. We use a clean dataset and visualize the top 10 most important features that influence prediction.



\##  **Features**



\- Data preprocessing and exploration

\- Model training using RandomForestClassifier

\- Feature importance analysis

\- Visualization of key predictors



\##  **Tools Used**



\- Python

\- Scikit-learn

\- Matplotlib

\- Seaborn

\- Google Colab



\##  **Dataset**



Although the original dataset for software bugs was unavailable, this prototype uses the breast cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets` as a sample for demonstration purposes.



\##  **Output**



The model visualizes the \*\*Top 10 Most Important Features\*\* contributing to classification.

\##  **How to Run**



1\. Open the Colab notebook.

2\. Run all the cells in sequence.

3\. Review the accuracy and feature importance output.



\##  **Future Work**



\- Replace the dataset with actual software defect data (e.g., PC1.csv).

\- Improve performance with model tuning or ensemble methods.

\- Deploy as a web app for developers to upload codebases and receive bug predictions.
